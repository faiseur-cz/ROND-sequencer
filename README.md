I finished the design and built a couple of them, all works as it should. So you can use the gerbers to make your own version.

There is a thread on modwiggler if you have any question :

ROND is an 8 step analog sequencer, kind of augmented (and circular!) baby8

- Pattern length rotary switch to set the number of steps in your sequence
- You can choose between two levels of CV (5v/2.5v), if you need more or less precision in the tuning of each step.
- Gates on/off for each step, on the right of the module.
- Run/Tune switch and Next Step push-button to facilitate tuning

CALIBRATION PROCEDURE :
- set the Run/Tune switch in TUNE position
- make sure the selected gate switch is ON (high position)
- monitor the CV output voltage and turn the trimpots until you reach precisely 5V and 2.5V
- DONE!
